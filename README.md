# Get: easy pre-built binary installation

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/zyedidia/get/blob/master/LICENSE)

Get is a tool for downloading and extracting prebuilt binaries from releases
on GitHub. To use it, provide a repository and `get` will search through the
assets from the latest release in an attempt to find a suitable prebuilt
binary for your system. If one is found, the asset will be downloaded and
`get` will extract the binary to the current directory. Get should only be
used for installing simple, static prebuilt binaries, where the extracted
binary is all that is needed for installation. For more complex installation,
you may use the `--download-only` option, and perform extraction manually.

For software maintainers, if you provide prebuilt binaries on GitHub, you can list `get`
as a one-line method for users to install your software.

# How to get get

Before you can get anything, you have to get get.

```
$ go get github.com/zyedidia/get
```

A man page can be generated by cloning the repository and running `make get.1`
(requires pandoc).

Pre-built binaries and a quick install script coming soon!
