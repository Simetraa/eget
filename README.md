# Eget: easy pre-built binary installation

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget/blob/master/LICENSE)

**Eget** is the best way to easily get pre-built binaries for your favorite
tools. It downloads and extracts pre-built binaries from releases on GitHub. To
use it, provide a repository and Eget will search through the assets from the
latest release in an attempt to find a suitable prebuilt binary for your
system. If one is found, the asset will be downloaded and Eget will extract
the binary to the current directory. Eget should only be used for installing
simple, static prebuilt binaries, where the extracted binary is all that is
needed for installation. For more complex installation, you may use the
`--download-only` option, and perform extraction manually.

For software maintainers, if you provide prebuilt binaries on GitHub, you can list `eget`
as a one-line method for users to install your software.

# How to get Eget

Before you can get anything, you have to get Eget.

```
$ go get github.com/zyedidia/eget
```

A man page can be generated by cloning the repository and running `make eget.1`
(requires pandoc).

Pre-built binaries and a quick install script coming soon!

# Options

Usage:
  eget [OPTIONS] REPO

Application Options:
  -t, --tag=           tagged release to use instead of latest
      --to=            extract to directory
  -s, --system=        target system to download for
  -f, --file=          file name to extract
  -q, --quiet          only print essential output
      --download-only  stop after downloading the asset (no extraction)
      --url            download from the given URL directly

# FAQ

### How is this different from a package manager?

Eget only downloads pre-built binaries uploaded to GitHub by the developers of the repository. It does not maintain a central list of packages, nor does it do any dependency management. Eget does not "install" executables by placing them in system-wide directories (such as `/usr/local/bin`) unless instructed, and it does not maintain a registry for uninstallation. Eget works best for installing software that comes as a single binary with no additional files needed (CLI tools made in Go, Rust, or Haskell tend to fit this description).

### Is this secure?

Eget does not run any downloaded code -- it just finds executables from GitHub releases and downloads/extracts them. If you trust the code you are downloading (i.e. if you trust downloading pre-built binaries from GitHub) then using Eget is perfectly safe. You can use the `--sha256` option to have Eget print the SHA-256 checksum of the downloaded file, and then you can check if this matches the checksum provided by the developers of the tool you downloaded (if they provide one).

### Does this work only for GitHub repositories?

At the moment Eget only supports searching GitHub releases. If you provide a direct URL instead of a GitHub repository and use the `--url` option, Eget will skip the detection phase and download directly from the given URL.
