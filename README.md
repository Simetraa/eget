# Get: easy pre-built binary installation

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/zyedidia/get/blob/master/LICENSE)

Get is a tool for downloading and extracting prebuilt binaries from releases
on GitHub. To use it, provide a repository and `get` will search through the
assets from the latest release in an attempt to find a suitable prebuilt
binary for your system. If one is found, the asset will be downloaded and
`get` will extract the binary to the current directory. Get should only be
used for installing simple, static prebuilt binaries, where the extracted
binary is all that is needed for installation. For more complex installation,
you may use the `--download-only` option, and perform extraction manually.

For software maintainers, if you provide prebuilt binaries on GitHub, you can list `get`
as a one-line method for users to install your software.

# How to get get

Before you can get anything, you have to get get.

```
$ go get github.com/zyedidia/get
```

A man page can be generated by cloning the repository and running `make get.1`
(requires pandoc).

Pre-built binaries and a quick install script coming soon!

# Options

```
Usage:
  get [OPTIONS] REPO

Application Options:
  -t, --tag=           tagged release to use instead of latest
      --to=            extract to directory
  -s, --system=        target system to download for
  -f, --file=          file name to extract
  -q, --quiet          only print essential output
      --download-only  stop after downloading the asset (no extraction)
      --url            download from the given URL directly
      --asset=         download a specific asset
      --rename=        rename extracted file to given name
  -x                   force the extracted file to be executable
      --sha256         show the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded asset
  -v, --version        show version information
  -h, --help           show this help message
```

# FAQ

### How is this different from a package manager?

Get only downloads pre-built binaries uploaded to GitHub by the developers of the repository. It does not maintain a central list of packages, nor does it do any dependency management. Get does not "install" executables by placing them in system-wide directories (such as `/usr/local/bin`) unless instructed, and it does not maintain a registry for uninstallation. Get works best for installing software that comes as a single binary with no additional files needed (CLI tools made in Go, Rust, or Haskell tend to fit this description).

### Is this secure?

Get does not run any downloaded code -- it just finds executables from GitHub releases and downloads/extracts them. If you trust the code you are downloading (i.e. if you trust downloading pre-built binaries from GitHub) then using get is perfectly safe. You can use the `--sha256` option to have get print the SHA-256 checksum of the downloaded file, and then you can check if this matches the checksum provided by the developers of the tool you downloaded (if they provide one).

### Does this work only for GitHub repositories?

At the moment get only supports searching GitHub releases. If you provide a direct URL instead of a GitHub repository and use the `--url` option, get will skip the detection phase and download directly from the given URL.
